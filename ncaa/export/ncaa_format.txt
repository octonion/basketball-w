-Other ID is for shot blocker or the player that secured the jump ball (if applicable)
-ActionType is any detail like shot type, turnover type, timeout type, etc. For example “Jump Shot” or “Lay-Up” or “Lost Ball Turnover”
-Option1 is: 2 or 3 for made/missed shots; FT_MADE or FT_MISSED for free throws; NO_STEAL or STEAL for turnovers
-Option2 you can put “NO_FAST_BREAK” or “FAST_BREAK” if applicable; we can also use this perhaps for shot distances or any other info you find in the play by play

Let me know if you have any questions.
